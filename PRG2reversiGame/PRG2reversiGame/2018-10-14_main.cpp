//Assignment 1: Reversi game (Due 1600 2/11/18)
/* Game conditions:
 - print ---- REVERSI ---- at beginning
 - board: 1-6 above each board space, a-f next to each row
 - row is signified by a letter a-f, column by number 1-6. The move
 would be specified for example by 'b4'
 - disks are 'O' or 'X' (capitalized)
 - disk swapping; when player's disk is next to opponents disk, and there's
 another player's disk on other side, ALL opponent's disks between the player's
 disks get flipped; works diagonally
 - disk MUST be able to flip an opponent's disk; otherwise move is illega
 "Player O does not have a move to play."
 - disk MUST be placed next to an opponent's disk
 - disk MUST be placed on empty spot
 - players alternate; if one player cannot make a valid move, play passes
 to other player. game ends when neither player can move --> when grid is
 full, or no piece can legally be placed in any remaining squares...
 - winner or tie declared
 - score printed at the end; number of x's or o's left on the board is the
 final score of each player
